			<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>
				I have only started working with PHP this semester and I have learned a bit of PHP. I feel confident I could learn more in it easily
				if I were to need to use it in future projects. The project below is meant to demonstrate some simple number manipulations using php
				that I worked on with a groupmate in the class.
