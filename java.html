			<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>
				During my time in highschool and in college I've used Java in a variety of projects. I originally learned the language in a semester
				long class in highschool and I have used it on and off in personal projects.
				
				The project below is one of the last projects that I worked on in my Java class. It is meant to be a game of hangman, in which a 
				random word was chosen by the program and it would give the user a hint on what the word was related to.
