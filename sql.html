			<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>
				I have been using sql for two years now. I began learning it at the beginning of the MIC program as it was the first college course
				I took. Being placed in my internship shortly afterward, I learned how to program in T-SQL although I cannot release the code for the
				projects I have made due to privacy reasons. Instead, I have released a project that I worked on with some classmates during that SQL
				class. It uses simple statements to enroll students into a school directory.
