			<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
			<p>
				I am a highschool student graduating from Lee's Summit High School. During my education there, I found and joined the MIC program,
				which allows highschool students to take college classes during their last two years and places them in an internship with an
				associated company. In the MIC program I have had the opportunity to learn various programming languages, like C++, Java, Javascript,
				SQl and more. At my internship with NRCCUA, I have been working with our Senior Database Administrator to learn T-SQL and now have
				had nearly a full year of experience working with them.
