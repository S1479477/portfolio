			<h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>
				I started working with Javascript in the fall of 2019 in college. Since then, I have taken more classes that build upon using
				Javascript and I have been assisting with some Javascript projects at my work. The project below is one of the last I worked on
				in my Advanced Web Development class. The program is meant to display a calculator in which the user can do basic calculations.
